                <h2>Technically Speaking</h2>
                <p> 
                    I'm an experienced software developer with a passion for learning and growing in the ever-evolving world of technology.
                    I love solving challenging problems and thrive on collaborating with people from different areas to tackle complex projects.
                    I aim to use my technical skills and creativity to build software that makes a positive impact on the community.

                <h2>with Experience</h2>
                <p> 
                    With a background in Computer Science and Information Systems, Ive had the opportunity to work on game development projects 
                    that have honed my skills across all stages of the development pipeline. From concept to deployment, Ive contributed to 
                    delivering frequent application releases with a focus on quality and efficiency. My experience includes server-side game development, 
                    where Ive worked extensively with Python, SQL, and database management to create robust and scalable systems

                <h2>Outside of the Digital World</h2>
                <p> 
                    Outside of tech, Im a creative and active person, exploring different passions. 
                    I enjoy painting and having displayed my work in galleries and local cafes. Hiking is another favorite pastime,
                    as it lets me connect with nature and recharge. Im also involved in community theatre, both on stage and behind the scenes, 
                    which has been an incredible way to collaborate and get involved with the community. Coming from Wellington, New Zealand, my love for coffee runs deepâ€”theres 
                    no better way to start the day!
